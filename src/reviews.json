            "text" : "Best hookah lounge in dfw by far. Super clean  awesome atmosphere and mood setting. The ladies do an amazing job on the hookah and go above and beyond to make sure the hookahs have no complaint. Their mint lemonade is a smoothie item but is awesome. For me, no hookah is complete without a mint lemonade frozen drink. I love the ambiance. I also love the fact that that owner came to us asking how our experience was and wanted feedback. An extremely kind guy.\n\nThis is my new goto place for hookah now.",
